# 29LiftsSupportApp
A WPF tool for changing states in the [29Lifts](https://github.com/cjesp/29Lifts) app when simulating a Lyft ride.

# Usage
Start a simulated ride by pressing "Request lyft" in [29Lifts](https://github.com/cjesp/29Lifts). 
The console will log the ride id and token, so copy those from the 29Lifts app to this one, and you can then
change the state of the ride.
